# Utility Bill Transparency Platform

### Problem Statement
Exposing electricity billing discrepancies by crowdsourcing and comparing anonymized utility data.

### Description
This project is a full-stack web application designed to bring transparency to electricity billing. Users can anonymously submit details from their electricity bills (provider, location, units consumed, and total amount). In return, the platform provides an immediate analysis, comparing their cost-per-unit to the average of other users in the same city with the same provider.

The goal is to empower consumers with data, helping them understand if they are being overcharged and providing a clearer picture of billing practices across different utility companies.
